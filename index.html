<p>Welcome to the greatest webpage in the <em>(virtual)</em> world!</p>
<p>My favorite place to find <strong>cool new memes</strong> is <a href="google.com">Gooble</a>.</p>

<p id="highlight">Memes about <strong><em>helth</em></strong> are my favorites right now, probably because we're in the middle of a global pandemic and it's easier to laugh about medical stuff than panic about our uncertain futures. Or maybe it's just funny that they spell it like that, who knows?</p>
